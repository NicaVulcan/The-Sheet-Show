## User Story

Sheet Show is a Web App designed to expedite character creation for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. The app allows users to create a character, save it to a database, and then view it on a character sheet. The character sheet is a dynamic page that is generated based on the user's input. The user can then edit the character and save the changes to the database. The user can also delete the character from the database.

- WHEN user navigates to website, THEN all existing characters are displayed.
- WHEN user creates an account, THEN user is redirected to the home-page logged in.
- WHEN user is logged in, THEN they have CRUD access to their own characters.
